# ProSlacker for Turtle WoW

### What is this ?
This is a simple **World of Warcraft 1.12** addon I created to automate certain tasks.  
Feel free to use and modify it as needed, but keep in mind it's primarily for personal use, so it's not guaranteed to be fully optimized or error-free.

### Instruction
Check the ProSlacker.lua file for specific instructions on creating in-game macros to use with this addon.  
Example:  
/run -- CastSpellByName("Sinister Strike")  
/script RogueAttack("Sinister Strike", "Cheap Shot")

### What else ?
Another good addon to use with this addon is SuperMacro.  
https://github.com/Monteo/SuperMacro  
It will help get the right icon with tooltip for the macro.

### Planned Features

- [ ] Make it so other people can use it also.
- [ ] Split it better up so it's easy to edit.
